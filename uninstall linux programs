//DEBIAN BASED DISTRUBUTION; 

sudo apt remove firefox;//remove only firefox not configuration all the assosiated dependiances
sudo apt purge firefox ;// all system config files , not remove dependencies
sudo apt autoremove // remove unneeded dependecies
or sudo apt update
home/.config //user config file can't touch by any package manager (for safety reason) so u have to remove it manually




//ARCH LINUX DISTRUBUTION;
sudo pacman -R program
sudo pacman -Rns program//only user config remains
 
 
 SNAP LIST // to see all installed snap packages
 sudo snap install firefox
 sudo find / -iname cornyjokes //searching in my root directory "/" cornyjokes;
 sudo snap remove cornyjokes //removed everything from root but only remaining in home ie.user directory
 
 FLATPACK LIST
 sudo flatpak uninstall <packageName> //ie com.github.Eloston.UngoogledChromium// removed all except in home directory
 
 
 for APPIMAGE go /home/dt/Application delete there
 but don't forget to delete config from home directory yourself
 
for tar.gz
in file installing:./config && make && make sudo make install 
uninstalling: sudo rm -rf pydoc3.12 ; /usr/local/bin; self installed app
2nd method very simple and recommended
sudo alien -d <compress-file-name> ; d means debian ; alien package change tar.gz to debian 
TO INSTALL DEBIAN FILE ;
sudo apt install <debian file-name> ; for deletion same as apt file deletion ie sudo apt purge firefox;
