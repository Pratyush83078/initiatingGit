arpanet (mit, stanford, ucla , utah) using TCP protocols; tcp/ip
Protocols: rules set by 
problem:research automated sharing was missing ie link is linking to another document/research paper etc;
then originate www: word wide web, Tim burner
search engine: Yahoo first; 

Protocols: set of rules and regulations ie to communications etc.ie sending emails to a person require a rules and regulations , internet society make these rules and regulations. 
server:  localhost server and client itself, developer tools network status,method etc...
client:

Protocols : format/rules of data assign how data sent or receive etc;
Tcp : not correpted , complete data
Udp : like video conferencing  
Http: web browser, 

packets of data,
Ip address : curl ifconfig.me -s, -s is not necessary

Isp: airtel, jio etc
global ip address, modem/router,
Dhcp ,nat,
modem decides

as all applications have same ip address(for one device) therefore to send data to a particular app they defined 
Port number:16 bits, 2^16
reserved port:

1kbps: 1kilobits/s 1000bits/s
mbps: 1megabits/sec 10^6bits/s
1gbps: 1gigabits/sec 10^9bits/s

submarinecable.com: optical fibre from different coutry, mumbai, cheenai, kerala
Pysically internet connected:
wireless:

INTERNET:
	LAN: office,local area: ethernet cable, wifi, 
	MAN: across a city
	WAN:across a countries ie optical fibre cables;
1)SONET:
2)FRAME RELAY:

TIER 1 Isp (india): tata chennai to singapore.Then , airtel jio etc.

Topologies: 
	bus;
	ring;
	star;
	tree(bus-star);
	mesh;expensive,scalability issue

Structure of the network;
OSI MODEL VERY IMP FOR INTERVIEW;
	OSI model: 1:06:38 7layers 
		application: software
		presentation:app send data 
		session , transport, network dataLink physical
	





DNS:
sub-domain, secondary domain, top level domain
	root dns server: top level domain, .io, .org,.com,   --first contact 
	rootsever.org
	top level domain: orgainsation specific ie : io - for educational, org- for not profitable orgainsation or general use also, .com - for commercial orgainsation, .in,.uk etc coutry specific;
	top level domain manage by ikan ;

	TO FIND IP ADDRESS OF A DOMAIN NAME	: first it checks in own computer(local storage), it not there then , ISP, then root server rootserver.org, then Top level domain (TLD) ie ikan; 
	
You can't buy a domain name but can rent it. 
dig google.com; server: ip address of google, saved in local ; 
man dig: dns lookup utility; 

TCP/IP MODEL OF APPLICATION LAYER ENDS AND TRANSPORT LAYER STARTS
	this layer has protocols ie tcp/udp , perform checksom and check shortest path. all 5 osi model layer lie in own device
	also manage port system etc ...
	
	multiplexing and demultiplaxing:
	sockets: connection between internet an application creates a socket using an api provided by os (eg: socket()in C and socket.socket()in python), stream socket(TCP), datagram Socket(UDP)...
